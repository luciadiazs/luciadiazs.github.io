  At the 2024 *Winter School for Advanced Quantitative Methods* organized by Q-Lab PUCP, I presented preliminary findings of my research on media representations of Venezuelan migrants in Peru (2016–2023).  
  The study employs Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze a dataset of tweets from Peruvian media outlets, providing insights into discursive patterns surrounding migration and social perception.
