summary: Presentation of research on gender perceptions in a Christian church in Lima, based on co-authored article.

abstract: |
  Together with my colleague Lucía Villegas, I presented the paper *“God Would Say to You ‘I Did Not Make You a Slave’: Perceptions of Women’s Roles in a Christian Church in Lima”*, based on our co-authored article with Brisa Cruz Pacheco published in *La Colmena*.  
  Drawing on François Dubet’s sociology of experience, our work examined the gender perceptions of women from the Agua Viva church in Lima and Callao, highlighting the tensions between traditional roles and aspirations for greater female participation in public life.  
  The discussion was enriched by insightful commentaries from Aranxa Pizarro and Katherine Sarmiento. The event reaffirmed the importance of creating and sharing knowledge collectively, as well as fostering spaces for critical reflection and dialogue.
