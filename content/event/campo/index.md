summary: Presentation and co-organization of the colloquium "Institutions and Violence," sharing methodological challenges and lessons from prison fieldwork in Cusco.

abstract: |
  As part of the Field Practice course (October 2023), a group of ten Sociology students conducted research in Cusco’s male and female prisons—recognized as some of the most productive correctional facilities in Peru. The project examined the economic and labor dimensions of incarcerated individuals and their connections with the outside world.  
  In June 2024, we organized the colloquium "Institutions and Violence" to disseminate research findings and methodological lessons. I presented in the panel "Methodology, Challenges, and Learnings," alongside Enmanuel Villar Paredes, where we discussed strategies for working with vulnerable populations, the importance of thorough pre-fieldwork preparation, and the need for flexible methodologies.  
  The event fostered dialogue with the Ayacucho research group, who investigated gender-based violence in educational institutions, creating a space for collective learning and exchange.
